# Part-of-Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

This project implements a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging system using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). POS tagging is the process of assigning a grammatical tag to each word in a given text.

## Overview

- The project uses the hmmlearn library for HMM implementation.
- The HMM is trained on a labeled dataset of sentences and their POS tags.
- The trained model predicts POS tags for new sentences.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- hmmlearn

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
pip install numpy hmmlearn


2. Prepare the training data:
- Create a labeled dataset of sentences and their corresponding POS tags.
- Store the sentences and POS tags in separate lists or arrays.

3. Update the code:
- Replace the `samples` list with your own training sentences.
- Modify the code as needed to match your dataset and requirements.

4. Run the code:
- Execute the code in a Python environment.
- The model will be trained on the provided dataset.
- The trained model will be used to predict the POS tags for the sentences.
- The predicted POS tags will be displayed as output.
